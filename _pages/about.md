Hi! I am currently a PhD student at the College of Computing and Data Science, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, supervised by Prof. Dusit Niyato (FIEE). Prior to this, I obtained a BEng degree at [Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://www.njupt.edu.cn/), Nanjing, China, under the guidance of Prof. Kun Wang (SMIEEE, now a full professor with the School of Microelectronics, Fudan University, Shanghai, China) and an MSc degree at the University of California, Los Angeles, USA, under the guidance of Prof. Lei He (FIEE).

My research is primarily centered around the utilization of Generative AI in Intelligent networks. Our key objective is to explore "how the intelligent networks can support various AI-Generated Content (AIGC) services", and "how generative AI as a cutting-edge machine learning tool can be used to improve the intelligent network performance, security, and reliability". This involves exploring the integration of various networking methodologies, including Semantic Communications, Resource Allocation, Integrated Sensing and Communications, and Metaverse. Please refer to this repository for the latest updates of Generative AI-related papers from our group!

Individually, our strength may have its limits; collectively, our potential is boundless. If you are interested to collaborate with me or just have a chat, please feel free to email me (hongyang001@e.ntu.edu.sg)! I am always happy to discuss with / learn from different minds ^_^!
